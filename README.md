# Advent of Code 2021

My Rust solutions and thoughts regarding Advent of Code 2021.
I am *not* attempting to compete for any leaderboards, just doing these for fun and to try out crates I haven't gotten around to using (enough).
So far these include:

- [`thiserror`](https://github.com/dtolnay/thiserror)
- [`array-init`](https://github.com/Manishearth/array-init)
- [`bitvec`](https://github.com/bitvecto-rs/bitvec)
- [`ndarray-linalg`](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray-linalg/)
- [`ndarray-stats`](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray-stats)
- [`chumsky`](https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/)

## Day 1

Day 1 is pretty straightforward, however, there is a fun, not immediately obvious way to improve the second part.
In digital signal processing, computing a moving average in fixed point is often optimized by only adding the newest value to the running sum and subtracting the removed value.
Essentially, this is a lossless integrator (normally unstable), followed by a comb filter.
However, as soon as you realize this, it becomes clear that if you are comparing consecutive windows and the update is `sum += new - old` you can just compare `new` and `old` directly, without computing the sum at all.

## Day 2

Nothing particularly interesting here.
Meh.

## Day 3

Straightforward, but you can play around with bit twiddling hacks.
And by partitioning the input instead of really changing the vector size you can avoid all allocations except those required during file reading.

## Day 4

Another boring one.

## Day 5

Fairly straightforward, but I decided to go for more standard loops here instead of trying to do everything with iterators, including using `BufRead::read_line` instead of `BufRead::lines` for input.
This one would have been more interesting if step two had required angles other than 45¬∞ (requiring something like [Bresenham's line algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm)).

## Day 6

This is the first one where the straightforward solution doesn't work for step two.
Also, [my initial step two solution](https://github.com/l0calh05t/advent-of-code-2021/blob/f694b9b13cfc00bbce58ffd09542bc645a7af981/day-06/src/main.rs) allowed me to channel my inner Sean Parent and exclaim [‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a rotate!‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZmeDQL4LaE)
But since everything worth doing is worth overdoing:
You can reduce the complexity from O(*n*) to O(log *n*) by converting the iteration to a 9√ó9 iteration matrix and using [exponentiation by squaring](https://electric-snow.net/2016/05/31/fibonacci-youre-also-doing-it-wrong/).
Or take it even further and diagonalize the matrix and compute the matrix power in O(1) as Re{P D‚Å∏‚Å∞ P‚Åª¬π}, which is what I did for this one (which also gave me an excuse to try [`ndarray-linalg`](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray-linalg/)).

DISCLAIMER: Don't expect this solution to be any faster.
Quite the opposite, since *n* = 256 isn't exactly a large number.

## Day 7

The simple solution of just iterating over [min, max] works just fine, but like Day 1, there is a neater solution, albeit for part one this time.
Part one is essentially asking to minimize the *L*‚ÇÅ norm deviation, which can be done by just computing the median (in *n*-D space this generalizes to the [geometric median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_median))!
For part two, I just went with the direct solution, although I did optimize fuel cost function by applying the knowledge that the described numbers are simply the [triangular numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number) which can be computed as *k*(*k* + 1)/2 (and actually happen to have been a topic in [my dissertation](https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/11291/), albeit their *n*-D generalization).

## Day 8

Classic deductive logic puzzle.
The only interesting thing I did was to use `include_str!` to embed the input this time.
Currently, not cleaned up at all.
Plenty of magic `bitvec` constants (i.e., magic numbers).
Ideas how to make this nicer are welcome.

## Day 9

I liked this one, because it's graphics-related, and I got to use `ndarray` more.
Part one is similar to [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) and can be implemented via 2D windowed iteration with padding to get the borders.
Part two is essentially a [flood fill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill) with a custom filling condition.

## Day 10

Oooh‚Ä¶ a parsing task!
Finally, a reason to try some of those parser combinator crates I've been eying üëÄ!
But [which](https://lib.rs/crates/chumsky) [to](https://lib.rs/crates/pom) [choose](https://lib.rs/crates/nom)?
I decided to try `chumsky` for this one, and was pretty happy with the result for part one, except for the fact that `chumsky`'s error type doesn't appear to implement `std::error::Error` (so no `color-eyre` this time).
Had the parser set up in a matter of minutes, and the error output already included all I needed.
For part two, I tried (and failed) to use `chumsky`'s error recovery mechanisms, but maybe I just used it incorrectly.
In the end, I just used the `expected` part of the error and appended the closing option to a mutable string buffer until everything parsed just fine.
Almost certainly not the most efficient solution, but easily fast enough (far below a second to parse every line *at least* three times).
I was generally pretty impressed with `chumsky`'s speed.

### Addendum

Added some basic timing code.
Part one takes roughly 5 ms and part two 54 ms.
And that's for the O(*n*¬≤) in recovery length approach I used!
